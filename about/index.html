As a professional I stand at the intersection of technology and business, specialising in designing, developing and implementing solutions to drive tangible business outcomes. I work with industry-leading enterprises and exceptionally talented individuals to transform technical potential into substantial business value and reshaping entire organisations.
I am deeply committed to continuous learning - for a list of courses and certifications visit Credentials, my Credly profile or LinkedIn. I strongly believe that technology is not a standalone solution in itself, but a component of a broader strategy, that includes its integration within the organisation and enhancing user experience. This belief drives my effort to stay up to date with technological advancements, understand business and market shifts and delve into user experience and technology adoption. Through this blog, I aim to share valuable perspectives and insights across these topics, which also helps me organise my thoughts and deepen my understanding.">
