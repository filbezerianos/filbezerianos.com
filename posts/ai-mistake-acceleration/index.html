                <p>AI is transforming the business and technology landscape, promising efficiency, innovation and better decision-making. However, for organisations already struggling with technology-business misalignment, structural and operational inefficiencies and lack of governance, AI will accelerate and amplify these challenges.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore how AI can accelerate some challenges currently faced by the organisations and outline some approaches to avoid these pitfalls.</p>
<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>There are multiple gaps and inefficiencies that AI can amplify and accelerate if these are not considered and addressed during the adoption journey. This has occurred in that past with the adoption of other technologies, such as Cloud, which required a change in strategy to pivot later in the journey and re-alignment of goals and objectives.</p>
<h3 id="strategies-misalignment">Strategies Misalignment</h3>
<p>Organisations that are facing challenges or inability to align their technology strategy with business objectives, will also fail to develop a clear AI strategy, leading to fragmented implementation and misaligned goals with the overall business objectives. Given the pace of change in AI and the fact that AI is new to most organisations, the lack of ability to align technology and business strategies poses a greater risk for the organisations. That is similar to the early days of Cloud adoption, where organisations did not have a clear Cloud strategy before starting migrating to Cloud which led to low ROI and missed opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="underestimating-costs">Underestimating Costs</h3>
<p>Developing realistic budgets and forecasts for AI projects, factoring in the cost of research, development, deployment, testing, maintenance and scaling is crucial. Organisations that do not have a mature budgeting and review mechanism may end up underestimating the cost of AI solutions and face the risk of ballooning costs. Similar to the unexpected higher costs in the Cloud many organisations faced due to underestimating usage and optimisation failures. Given that the cost of AI solutions can be significantly higher than traditional workloads, this inability of budgeting, forecasting and reviewing cost of technology poses a greater risk for organisations during AI adoption.</p>
<h3 id="governance-and-oversight">Governance and Oversight</h3>
<p>AI systems require a robust governance mechanism to ensure compliance and operation as intended. Organisations that do not have a robust governance with clear accountabilities in place will face significant challenges at a greater scale and must develop contingency plans to address these issues. Lack of mature governance within an organisation will lead to significant risk when adopting AI, due to the complexity of the systems and new and evolving regulatory and compliance requirements across regions.</p>
<h3 id="integration-with-existing-systems-and-processes">Integration with Existing Systems and Processes</h3>
<p>Another area where organisations may face greater challenges with the adoption of AI is its integration with existing systems and processes. Organisations that do not have the mechanisms and have not developed the muscle to adopt new technologies and ways of working will struggle making the necessary changes required to adopt AI at scale. For example, from system integration perspective there may be compatibility issues, data silos and legacy technology which impede the smooth implementation of AI. Similarly, the probabilistic nature of AI may impose additional challenges integrating it to existing processes and workflows.</p>
<h3 id="data-quality-and-management">Data Quality and Management</h3>
<p>Organisation with immature data practices have experienced slow innovation and inability to make data-driven decisions. Adopting AI within the organisation with poor quality data, lack of data governance and inadequate data management practices will amplify errors and lead to biased and inaccurate AI outputs. Adoption of AI could be an opportunity for organisation to address data quality and management issues, however these impediments and challenges around data should be acknowledged and address as part of the overall data and AI strategy.</p>
<h3 id="skills-gaps">Skills Gaps</h3>
<p>For a successful implementation and adoption of AI organisations must invest in upskilling their employees. Organisations lacking upskilling and training programs will fail to provide the continuous training to keep pace with the AI advancements. Hiring AI specialists could be considered to cover skill gaps, however failing to upskill employees will lead to increased inefficiencies and reliance on external consultants.</p>
<h1 id="approaches-to-avoid-pitfalls">Approaches to Avoid Pitfalls</h1>
<h3 id="ai-and-data-strategy">AI and Data Strategy</h3>
<p>Organisations with poor data management practices must develop a clear data strategy and prioritise data quality - e.g. cleaning existing data, establish data governance frameworks, continuous data monitoring and validation etc. Once the data quality and management concerns have been addressed, organisations must develop a holistic AI strategy, ensuring that AI initiatives are aligned with the overall business objectives. The outcomes of these AI initiatives must be defined clearly and the appropriate metrics and KPIs to measure success must be agreed. A sensible approach is to start with a pilot project to test AI implementation on a smaller scale, learn from the experience and scale gradually.</p>
<p>The AI strategy should not focus only on the technical aspects, and should consider adoption strategies across the organisation, employee upskilling requirements, change management etc.</p>
<h3 id="cost-management-and-optimisation">Cost Management and Optimisation</h3>
<p>Alongside the AI strategy, organisations must develop realistic budgets and forecasts for AI initiatives. The end-to-end cost, throughout research, development, deployment, testing and maintenance, of the AI solutions must be considered and a plan to regularly review and adjust budget and resource allocations must be implemented. The allocation of the budget to specific AI initiatives must be aligned with business objectives and the success metrics for each AI initiative. In addition, organisations must establish clear end-to-end visibility and accountability of the cost of the AI solutions.</p>
<h3 id="robust-oversight-mechanisms">Robust Oversight Mechanisms</h3>
<p>A robust governance framework specifically for AI, outlining roles and responsibilities, must be designed and implemented. The implementation of governance must not be an afterthought and while at the initial phases of AI adoption at a smaller scale the governance may be lighter, as AI is adopted by the wider organisation, strong AI governance policies to address bias, regulatory requirements and security is crucial. Continuous monitoring of AI systems that track decisions, compliance and outcomes in real-time is important as AI adoptions is expanding to ensure that the organisation remains compliant and inline with policy and regulatory requirements.</p>
<h3 id="skills-development-and-training">Skills Development and Training</h3>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The adoption of AI holds immense potential for transforming businesses and drive innovation. However, it comes with significant challenges that can amplify and accelerate existing mistakes and inefficiencies. By learning from previous technology adoption experiences, like Cloud, organisations can develop the right strategies to manage and address these challenges ensuring that they harness the full potential of AI while avoiding pitfalls.</p>
